# ABC-SN
The Attention Based Classifier for Supernovae (ABC-SN) is a neural network classification model, inspired by the Transformer, to classify supernovae into subtypes based on their spectra.

# Usage
Please see [tutorials/HowTo_classify_with_ABCSN.ipynb](https://github.com/FoxFortino/ABC-SN/blob/main/tutorials/HowTo_classify_with_ABCSN.ipynb) to get started classifying supernovae with ABC-SN.
